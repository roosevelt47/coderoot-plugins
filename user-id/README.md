Simple plugin to get the ID of the recipient of a thread.

To download the plugin, use `[p]plugins roosevelt47/coder00t_plugins/user-id`

If you use `[p]userid` in a thread, the bot will send the recipient id, if you
use it in a channel which is not a thread channel, then the bot will send your
id.

Command name: `userid`
